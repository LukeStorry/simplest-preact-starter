# simplest-preact-starter
A very simple starter for single page preact apps, no build step required.

`npx servor --browse --reload` will launch a hot-reloading [servor](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/servor).


Uses [htm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htm).

Inspired by [this](https://formidable.com/blog/2019/no-build-step/) article.
